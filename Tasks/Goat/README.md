Task:
====
Create a program that takes as input a specified number of goats (1 to 1000), traversals (1 to 1000) and the individual weight of every goat (1 to 100,000). 

The input should be in the following form:

[number of goats] [number pf traversals]

[weight of goat #1] [weight of goat #2] ...

The program has to calculate the smallest possible boat that can be used to move all  the goats from one side of the river to the other given the specified weights and traversals. (The person moving the goats always tries to move the biggest goat and)
