#Strawberries Algorithm

Task:
====
Create a program that takes as input a the size of a 2D board (square or rectangular) that contains a strawberry in every cell; the number of bad strawberries (1 or 2), their location on the 2D board and the number of turns for which the simulation should run.

With every turn the bad strawberries infect all the adjacent strawberries (horizontally and vertically but NOT diagonally). 

The program should output the number of good strawberries left after the simulation has finished.
